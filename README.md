# Tensorflow Guides
A bunch of implementations of common machine learning architectures, both neural
and not neural, using tensorflow. This is meant to be a learning avenue for me
as I try to solidify new ideas I read about, while also being a useful resource
for others trying to learn more about machine learning, deep learning or tensorflow.

## Implemented Models
- Variational Autoencoders with Multinomial Likelihood`in progress`
- Convolutional Variational Autoencoders
- Probabilistic Matrix Factorization `in progress`
- Seq2seq Encoder Decoder (with Attention) `in progress`
